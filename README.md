# 🌤️ Weather Prediction Project — Data Mining Course

Predicting weather types, temperature, and humidity for the next 3 hours using real data from Weatherbit API (Hanoi, 2024).

---

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project applies the CRISP-DM methodology to build and evaluate models for weather forecasting based on a full year of hourly data (01/01/2024 - 01/01/2025). It tackles both classification (weather types) and multi-output regression (temperature & humidity).

## ⚙️ Key Steps

- 📊 **Data Understanding & EDA:** Deep dive into the weather dataset, uncovering patterns and cleaning data  
- 🔎 **Feature Selection & Engineering:** Identify and craft features that boost model performance  
- 🤖 **Modeling:**  
  - Classification with Random Forest, Naive Bayes, SVM, and XGBoost  
  - Multi-output Regression with Random Forest, XGBoost, Linear Regression, and MLP Regressor  
- 🧪 **Testing & Evaluation:** Compare models rigorously using appropriate metrics  
- 📈 **Visualization:** Insightful charts to explain model results and data trends
